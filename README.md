# Pig Latin Converter

## Current Features
* Converts a whole sentence of words to Pig Latin
* Any words that have capital letters maintain their capitalization form.  In other words, a word with a second letter that is capitalized will continue to have a second letter capitalized after the conversion.
* Any punctuation at the beginning or end of a word will be maintained.
* Any additional spaces between words will be maintained.

## Additional Feature Ideas
* Maintain punctuation in the middle of a word.
* Switch to "Consonant Cluster" version, such that __Scram__ becomes __Amscray__ instead of __Cramsay__
* Remove any ending vowels prior to conversion, such that __Abba__ becomes __Abbay__ instead of __Abbaay__.
